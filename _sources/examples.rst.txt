Examples
========

Examples are stand-alone code snippets that live in the Astropy documentation which demonstrate a specific functionality within a package.
Examples don't provide conceptual background/context or exhaustive explanation of the functionality being demonstrated.
Examples have less explanationâ€”they may prompt questions which can be answered by scrolling up and down into the documentation.

See the `Astropy Examples <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/index.html>`_ for a structured view of the examples within the Astropy project.
