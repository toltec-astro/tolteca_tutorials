Recipes and Scripts
===================

Recipes and scripts are utility code snippets that comes as part of the
`tolteca <https://github.com/toltec-astro/tolteca>`_ package,
which implements a set of specific, high-level TolTEC data related tasks.

Some of these tasks are used as part of the TolTEC data acquisition system,
and some of them is used for operation and maintenance of the data archive.

Recipes and scripts offer a command-line interface and the level of
extensiveness of the documentation within each recipe/script may vary.

See `tolteca/recipes <https://github.com/toltec-astro/tolteca/tree/master/tolteca/recipes>`_
and `tolteca/scirpts <https://github.com/toltec-astro/tolteca/tree/master/tolteca/scripts>`_ for more details.
