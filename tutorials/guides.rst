Guides
======

The guides are long-form narrative, comprehensive, conceptually-focused documents (chapter-ish) providing stand-alone introductions to core packages in addition to the underlying astronomical concepts (e.g., CCDproc with observing-lite/image reduction).
These guides will be a series of tutorials joined with conceptual/explanatory "glue."

Coming soon!

Example: `Astronomical Spectroscopy by Massey & Hanson <https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5270>`_
