    "# Create workdir and load RuntimeContext\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors: Zhiyuan Ma\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn the concept of workdir and `tolteca.utils.RuntimeContext`.\n",
    "* Create workdir with `tolteca setup` commandline.\n",
    "* Create workdir and load `RuntimeContext` with Python API.\n",
    "* Load `RuntimeContext` in-memory without workdir.\n",
    "* Use `RuntimeContext` to access config dict and runtime info.\n",
    "* Use `RuntimeContext.setup` to persist runtime info.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "General; Environment; Commandline interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the concept and use of the so-called \"tolteca workdir\", as well as the `tolteca.utils.RuntimeContext` class which interacts with it programatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tolteca workdir is a directory prepared by tolteca, which contains special sub-directory structure and files that are recognized and managed by the tolteca package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tolteca workdir provides the user experience similar to a python virtual environemnt. User can create many workdirs, each of which has its own config setup for a certain task or project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tolteca workdir plays a central role for all the commandline interface\n",
    "commands tolteca provides. When the `tolteca ...` command is invoked, a `tolteca.utils.ConfigLoader` object is created (the instance is made available through global variable `tolteca.cli.config_loader`), and the `ConfigLoader.runtime_context_dir` property carries the path to the current workdir to be loaded. By default, the `runtime_context_dir` is set to current directory, but can be specified via `tolteca -d <workdir> ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commandline functionalities (`tolteca.simu`, `tolteca.reduce`, etc.) invoked through the `tolteca ...` commandline interface makes use of the `runtime_context_dir` to initialize a `RuntimeContext` object, through which it pulls in any configs user may have specified in the workdir and carries on the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tolteca workdir provides the isolation and persistence for keeping track of the software version and config dicts, which are needed for easy re-producing of previous results. Therefore, this is the recommended way of running analysis that involves a lot of config items and data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`RuntimeContext` can also be created with config dict or config file directly in-memory, without the presence or use of workdir. This mode can be useful when the tolteca submodules which expects a `RuntimeContext` object, but are used by other scripts or modules, which have their own config dict and runtime info management plan."

    "## Create tolteca workdir\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commandline interface (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of tolteca workdir is typically done with the commandline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ tolteca -d workdir0 setup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a directory named `workdir0` in the current directory, with some initial contents similar to:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we can, however, create the workdir directly using the Python API provided by tolteca.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the tutorial independent of any user's own system setup, we use a temporary directory:"
