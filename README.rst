TolTECA Tutorials
=================

This repository contains the tutorials for TolTEC data analysis.

To see the tutorials rendered as static web pages, see the Github page
`TolTECA tutorials
site <https://toltec-astro.github.io/tolteca_tutorials>`_.

How to run
----------

To run the tutorials interactively, you'll need to make sure you have `Jupyter
notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ installed, then clone or download this
repository. The notebook files themselves live in the ``tutorials`` directory
of this repository, organized by the names of the tutorials.

In addition to the ``*.ipynb`` file, each subfolder also contains a
``requirements.txt`` listing the dependencies required to run the notebook.
To install, run:

.. code::

   $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

It is highly recommended to create a dedicated virtual environment for all
the tutorials to run in.
